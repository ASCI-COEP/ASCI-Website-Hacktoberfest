                                and
                                make it

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Be calm. Understand and imbibe the incoming question first, before you start outputting
                                an
                                answer.
                            </li>
                            <li>Don't just sit while you develop a solution, think out loud. It helps when they can
                                understand where you
                                are going with an approach.</li>
                            <li>Tailor your resume to the job you are applying.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Do Fest/ Club Participation and Roles really matter?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For fests, as far as I can tell, the simple answer is NO in terms of job
                                placements.However, it is tough to
                                quantify the soft skills you develop there. </li>
                            <li>Nevertheless, having a technical project to talk
                                about on your
                                resume could be better than having a fest participation.</li>
                            <li>Clubs matter only when they are
                                technical and
                                you can show the impact and the output of your own work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>How important are letter of recommendations? Who should you get them from and how?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For job placements, I haven't come across a requirement for LORs. However, for higher
                                studies you do
                                require them.</li>
                            <li>As a general rule, try to get them from someone who can say that they worked
                                with on you
                                on some XX project or work, and that you showed YY qualities which they believe will
                                help
                                you succeed
                                in the place you are applying to.</li>

                        <li>What are the prime points to prepare for before going to an interview?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expect questions on your resume. Prepare to sell it.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared for the fact that
                                they may skip
                                your resume altogether, so don't fret if they do.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>What is the flow of the interview?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Really depends on the interviewer.</li>
                            <li>Some like to cover depth when exploring a topic. Some
                                like to cover
                                breadth.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared for both.</li>

                                            resume could be better than having a fest participation. Clubs matter only when they are
                                            technical and
                                            you can show the impact and the output of your own work.

                                            For job placements, I haven't come across a requirement for LORs. However, for higher
                                            studies you do
                                            require them. As a general rule, try to get them from someone who can say that they worked
                                            with on you
                                            on some XX project or work, and that you showed YY qualities which they believe will help
                                            you succeed
                                            in the place you are applying to.

                                            Expect questions on your resume. Prepare to sell it. Also, be prepared for the fact that
                                            they may skip
                                            your resume altogether, so don't fret if they do.

                                            Really depends on the interviewer. Some like to cover depth when exploring a topic. Some
                                            like to cover
                                            breadth. Be prepared for both.
                                        </p>
