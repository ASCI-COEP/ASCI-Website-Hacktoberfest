                            <li>Sometimes just explanation of project
                                is sufficient
                                but many times interviewer goes in details about what exactly you did in project, what
                                are
                                your technical

                                interviewer can ask
                                you questions about technology you worked on project assuming you have experience
                                working on
                                it.

                        </ul>
                        <li>Some tips for interviews?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must be confident on your learnings and whatever you have on resume.</li>
                            <li>Do some analysis
                                whenever you
                                face a rejection and try to improve on areas where you went wrong.</li>
                            <li>In case of on-campus
                                process, try to
                                recover from rejection as quickly as possible.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared before placement season starts(
                                on-campus)
                                because you hardly get little time to prepare when companies are lined up each day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Do Fest/ Club Participation and Roles really matter?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Depends :)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>How important are letter of recommendations? Who should you get them from and how?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For off-campus placement drives referrals are much important to get you test
                                link/interview
                                call.</li>
                            <li>Best
                                way to get referrals is grow you community on platforms like LinkedIn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>What are the prime points to prepare for before going to an interview?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prepare your resume well and know each and every point you mentioned on your resume in
                                detail.</li>
                            <li>
                                Study
                                well about work areas and technologies used in that specific company (which you are
                                targeting).
                            </li>
                            <li>Always
                                try to end interview on good note and I think chance to do that is when interviewer asks
                                you
                                about your
                                question for them at the end.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>What is the flow of the interview?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Again flow of interview depends on interviewer.</li>
                            <li>In most of the cases interviews starts with
                                your
                                introduction and questions on resumes.</li>
                            <li>Also in most interviews algo/coding questions are
                                kept at the
                                last. But I think there is no any fixed flow for interview.</li>
                        </ul>

                                        <p class="ans">
                                            Questions related to project depends on interviewer. Sometimes just explanation of project
                                            is sufficient
                                            but many times interviewer goes in details about what exactly you did in project, what are
                                            your technical
                                            learnings, basic design of project, problems faced during implementation etc. Also
                                            interviewer can ask
                                            you questions about technology you worked on project assuming you have experience working on
                                            it.

                                        <h6>5. Some tips for interviews?</h6>
                                        <p class="ans">
                                            Just be confident on your learnings and whatever you have on resume. Do some analysis
                                            whenever you
                                            face a rejection and try to improve on areas where you went wrong. In case of on-campus
                                            process, try to
                                            recover from rejection as quickly as possible. Be prepared before placement season starts(
                                            on-campus)
                                            because you hardly get little time to prepare when companies are lined up each day.
                                        </p>

                                        <h6>7. How important are letter of recommendations? Who should you get them from and how?</h6>
                                        <p class="ans">
                                            For off-campus placement drives referrals are much important to get you test link/interview
                                            call. Best
                                            way to get referrals is grow you community on platforms like LinkedIn.
                                        </p>
                                        <h6>8. What are the prime points to prepare for before going to an interview?</h6>
                                        <p class="ans">
                                            Prepare your resume well and know each and every point you mentioned on your resume in
                                            detail. Study
                                            well about work areas and technologies used in that specific company (which you are
                                            targeting). Always
                                            try to end interview on good note and I think chance to do that is when interviewer asks you
                                            about your
                                            question for them at the end.

                                        <h6>9. What is the flow of the interview?</h6>
                                        <p class="ans">
                                            Again flow of interview depends on interviewer. In most of the cases interviews starts with
                                            your
                                            introduction and questions on resumes. Also in most interviews algo/coding questions are
                                            kept at the
                                            last. But I think there is no any fixed flow for interview.
